# chat-program
Simple Chat Program 
In this simple chat program that I created for my internship course, I have used  multithreading, Tkinter GUI, and some socket programming. There are some bugs in this program that I somehow managed, but I'm so sorry for that. Feel free to use this project and imporove it. Let me know if you improved it in anyway. After all it's fun. 

HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT : 
  1. First install python-3.7.4
  2. Then open CMD and type these commands :
    python -m pip install Pillow
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    
  3. Fisrt run Server.py. In order to that you should open CMD and go to project directory and then type : Server.py 
  4. Then Enter local ip if you want to test this project on one computer. Write 127.0.0.1 
  5. If you connect some computers to a switch and use your ip for Server and tell other computers to use your ip as admin, you can chat between these computers ( The main purpose of creating this program was to simpfily communications between Hardware section staff, so that they could chat with eachother. One of guys had one of these old phones that you could only call or text, and he couldn't install any of new chat programs for smart phones. So there I come with this stupid program. ) 
  6. Easily run Client.pyw. Because it's format is .pyw you can just double click on it and it will run. 
  7. Enter the same ip you entered for Server.py. 
  8. Now check CMD for Server.py. You can see that one client has joined. Add as many clients as you want. 
  9. DONE
